# Chat App

Created in Express with Redis and MongoDB and Next.js Frontend.
Handles Session management with JWT. Only made backend as of yet.
Messages will be 'queued' until user is online and once he is they will be 'sent' to his device via WebSocket.
Users will be able to have groupchats with other users.
Nextjs frontned hasnt been made yet. Only most of backend (since its too long to create robust frontend)
